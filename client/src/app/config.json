            "My name is Joshua Sohn. Much of my childhood was surrounded by the tune of church hymns, classical symphonies and rock music.  The turning point of my musical journey came when my mother passed away at age 14. While coping her loss, I used music to help express what I was feeling. The power of music became a source of healing and now would like to pass that on to others with my own writing.",
            "Now almost 20 years later, I've developed a career in music, working with TV (Dwight in Shining armor, Air Force Reserve), feature films (Resilience and the Lost Gems, The Adventure of A.R.I.: My Robot Friend) and various production music companies including Velvet Green Music, AMADEA, and Gothic Storm."

Josh worked his magic and after I made a few tweak suggestions, he sent me a preliminary track.  Before we started, I warned Josh that my client had very specific music taste and there would probably be multiple revisions.  Surprisingly, the client was happy with the original piece Josh created and he never asked for any changes.  Josh was fast, attentive and made me look quite good."

We were able to have a simple meeting explain the emotion and the vibe I wanted with the music and he went in the studio and created his magic. As a filmmaker having the right music is very important but having a better music composer who is professional and willing to go the extra mile is a real asset and priceless to your project."

Josh does good work and I recommend him."
